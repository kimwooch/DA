## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```

##Technical Skill Showcase

This is a dynamic, database-backed web app that is developed using Ruby on Rail framework, strictly folllowing MVC design pattern. My development skills include unit testing, partials on the view, modeling database, etc. The development proces started with Behavioral Driven Development (BDD) and then mostly followed Testing Driven Development (TDD). It has a sign-up page to store properly formated input and returns error message if user provides invaid input.
